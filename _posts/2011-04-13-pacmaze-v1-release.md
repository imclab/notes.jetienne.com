## tl;dr;

Pacmaze v1 is a pacman in WebGL. You are a pacman trapped in a maze.
You need to eat all the pills to get out, and avoid the ghosts in the
process. Well... you known pacman.
You can find it as [standalone webapp](http://pacmaze.com) or in
[chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ggeliggglgbhachnoljoieibaneidchi).
Pacmaze v1 is the first game of *the pacmaze experiment*.

## Pacmaze Experiment

What is it ?
**The pacmaze experiment** is the fancy name for *my trip discovering gamedev field*.
It is an experiment i wish to try. The rule is simple.
During 4 months, i am commited to code in a *publish early, publish often* mode.
Twice a month, i will publish a new game, or a significant improvement of a
previous one, on the second and the fourth wednesday.

This is the current plan... I know the schedule is tight, but this
is part of the challenge. We will see how it goes along the road.

## Pacmaze Experiment Origin

Pacmaze V0 started on 14 march 2011 with a [36h code rush](/Pacmaze%20Experiment/2011/03/21/pacmaze-v0-origin.html).
It was a [proof-of-concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept).
Its purpose was to know if the needed technology was available on today browsers.
*Good news! it is* :)

Obviously to code a [multiplayer fps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter) in 36h,
you have to cut a lot of corners.
[Pacmaze v0](http://pacmaze0.jetienne.com) is ugly and got a crappy gameplay.
Additionnaly, a code rush was nice and fancy but it doesnt produce a stable code base.
I ended with a program which has been hacked rapidely. On top i was a beginner in
the [gamedev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development) field.
So i spent some time to refactor the code from 36h hack to something more stable.

I did many visual enhancements, improved the gameplay quite a bit... and then
you got [Pacmaze v1](http://pacmaze.com). have fun :)
