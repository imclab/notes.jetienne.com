title: Pacmaze v2 - Event More WebGL in Pacman
---

<a href='http://pacmaze.com' target='_blank'>Pacmaze</a> v2 is the second version of pacmaze
in the <a href='/2011/04/13/pacmaze-v1-release.html'>pacmaze experiment announced here</a>.

Compared to <a href='http://pacmaze1.jetienne.com' target='_blank'>pacmaze v1</a>, it provides **much nicer 3D effects** with
lot of camera moves. Use *pageUp/pageDown* or *C/V* keys to change the camera positions. It is a little easier
on the user too. In case you dont have WebGL, you may watch a screencast... better than the original
with a alert(), couch :) Show, dont tell, here is the screencast

Other improvements were done this week, but they were either not yet ready or not visible on the screen...
According to *pacmaze experiment* <a href='/2011/04/13/pacmaze-v1-release.html'>schedule</a>, i should
release a new game every 2 weeks, so another game is due next wednesday. 
<a href='http://pacmaze.com' target='_blank'>Pacmaze</a> v2 is just an improvement of last week
release.

## tl;dr;

Pacmaze is a pacman in WebGL. You are a pacman trapped in a maze.
You need to eat all the pills to get out, and avoid the ghosts in the
process. Well... you known pacman.
You can find it as [standalone webapp](http://pacmaze.com) or in
[chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ggeliggglgbhachnoljoieibaneidchi).
