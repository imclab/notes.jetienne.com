title: Pacmaze V0 - First multi-player first person shooter on html5 
---

Last week, i started to do gamedev.
During a code rush, i did pacmaze v0 in *36h!!!* Then i slept a lot and published it as
[chrome application](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ggeliggglgbhachnoljoieibaneidchi)
(This way, i didnt have to care about cross-browser compatbility out of time and lazyness i admit :)

Pacmaze v0 is a [multi-player first person shooter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter).
Everybody joins in the same maze, and they shoot at each other. Lets the best win... except
that nobody dies because i forgot to code death :)

To my knowledge, Pacmaze v0 is the first
[multi-player first person shooter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter#Multiplayer)
using html5 power with [WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)
and [WebSockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets).
You can find the game as standalone [here](http://pacmaze0.jetienne.com). have fun. I certainly
had fun writing it :)
